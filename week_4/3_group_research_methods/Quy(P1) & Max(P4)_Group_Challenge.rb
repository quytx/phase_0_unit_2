def my_array_deletion_method(source, thing_to_delete)
  source.delete_if{|x| x.to_s.include?(thing_to_delete)}

end

# Identify and describe the ruby method you implemented. 
# The method I used for this challenge was .delete_if
# Here is a bit on how this method works:
#
# Arrays:
# array.delete_if{|x| block}
#
# The method takes x and goes through each array index and performs whatever code you put in the block. This is similar to
# the array.each method. For example, if you had an array of numbers, and wanted to remove all numbers in the array that were
# greater than 10, you would write the following.
#
# array.delete_if{|x| x > 10}
#
# In my code above, I passed the block x.to_s.include?(thing_to_delete)
# This goes through each index of the array, converts the value to a string, and checks if that value includes thing_to_delete
# The .include? method will fail if you are searching for a string, and the value is an integer, so you need the .to_s method
# in order to get past any errors.
#
#
# Hashes:
# hash.delete_if{|key,value| block}
#
# Similar to the array method above, this method goes through each key/value pair of the hash, and executes the block. I used
# the same block as in my array method to achieve the same result.
